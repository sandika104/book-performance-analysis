A : The majority of adults are active and leave many reviews for every book they buy. This also means that adult literacy is very high when compared to younger or older people. The next step is to find out what kind of books these adults like. But since this dataset has limited information, that cannot be done here.

### 9. Is there a difference in the rating of the book between different locations?

A : Each country has a different level of literacy. With the highest level of literacy being in the USA, followed by Canada, UK, Spain, Germany and so on. And this is related to the location where the book is published.

### 10. Is there a relationship between the book's rating and other factors such as author, publisher, or publication year?

A : Based on the data above, the rating of a book is positively proportional to the increase in the number of books written by the author. And the increase in book writing is positively proportional to the increase in the number of publishers. For example, books classified as "MiddleAgeBooks" experience a significant increase in the number of ratings when authors and publishers increase.
